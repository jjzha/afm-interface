People, organizations and corporations are continuously adding different types of information to the web, they are connecting to each other on the web, they collaborates on tasks via the web, and they are logging how users view and interact with the web. Web Intelligence is the application of machine intelligence to the web in a broad sense. It combines theories and techniques from information retrieval, network science and machine learning. While nominally concerned with the \"web\", the techniques introduced in this course are widely applicable to information and data resources that have a network structure, such as social networks (Facebook, Twitter, ...),\u00a0 networks of customers and products on e-commerce platforms, or networks of documents linked by citations. Core topics that will be covered in the course include:  Information retrieval, search, and ranking Social network analytics Information diffusion on networks Neural network approaches for prediction on networks Recommender systems |\n | Academic content and conjunction with other modules/semesters |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n | Scope and expected performance                                | It should be stressed that AAU expects each student to spend 30 hours of study per ECTS credit, amounting to 150 hours  The course is designed to cover 5 ECTS.  It will consist of 11 lectures of two hours, and two hours exercise sessions before the lectures. These exercises will be complemented by self-study assignments consisting of larger exercises on implementing and experimenting with the techniques introduced in the lectures. The self-studies are designed to be conducted in  weekly 4 hour special exercise time slots.
