The courses are a combination of lectures, assignment calculation, and independent study (and perhaps combined with workshops and digital elements). The assignment calculations are made in the group with lecturer support and/or assistant teachers support from time to time. Courses are assessed separately – i.e., a final exam is held.

As such, there is no compulsory attendance to courses, but there may be some courses where the prerequisite for passing or taking the exam requires some participation. 
In practice, it will be a necessary condition for getting benefit and completing the training that you participate actively in both courses, project work, and that you prepare at home.

You will still be associated with a group for group work for the courses.

If you have received credit transfer for course units, you are welcome to follow the teaching, but you are not allowed to participate in the exam.

You can read more about credit transfer and the credit transfer obligation on the study guidance page here.

You will be able to find yourself on a digital exam when you are enrolled correctly, and the exam is created. You may be enrolled for several exams, but only find one exam in Digital Exam, with your name.

Before splitting the group, there must be a clarifying meeting with the whole group, principal supervisor and semester coordinator.

As a rule, splitting must take place in good time before the end of the project period. Ask your study secretary for the exact deadline for splitting up groups at your study programme.

All students in the group have equal rights to the material (documents, data, prototypes, experimental setups, etc.) that exists at the time of the split.

In order to avoid plagiarism (read more about plagiarism here) when the same material wholly or partly is included in several project reports, it is important that the group prepares a short author statement (with information on the material prepared jointly and could be included in several project reports) The author statement must be signed.

You must inform your study secretary about a group split.

In some programs, there are administratively formed groups, which means that it is the administration that controls the group formation process.

The project work consists of you in the project group preparing a project that, within certain limitations, is designed and solved by yourself. This group work is referred to as problem-based and project-oriented group work (read more under the heading "PBL").

All groups have an associated supervisor who will guide you on an ongoing basis.

If necessary, read the heading "Exclusion rules".

If you need to get it signed, you can take it to your study secretary. Remember to bring your AAU card.

### Study secretaries – who are they and where do I find them?

A study secretary is attached to each programme. The study secretary's tasks include, in collaboration with teachers, tutors and other secretaries, planning your schedules and exams, as well as guiding and referring you to the right departments at AAU.

The study secretaries in Esbjerg are secretaries for several programs, so remember to always write which study programme, you are attending, and your student number when you contact us. Then it is much easier and faster to help you.

You can find an overview of all the secretaries in Esbjerg here.
If your own secretary is not available during office time, one of the other secretaries are happy to help J

Our office hours are:
Monday-Friday 8.00 am - 15.00 pm

### Study Start Test - when will it be held, and do I have to participate?

### Withdrawal/Dropping out – What to do if I want to quit my study programme?

If you wish to quit your study programme, you must drop out via STADS self-service. You are always welcome to drop by your study secretary if you are unsure about anything in this regard. Otherwise, it may also be a good idea to have a chat with your student counsellor and/or your semester coordinator before you drop out.

Please send the receipt you receive from STADS to your study secretary.

AAU may also terminate your enrolment if you do not meet the applicable requirements for study activity.
